The **purpose of this project** is to have some **well-written** and **well-documented code** in a GitHub repository that illustrates you can write some Python code. This project is for **your** Portfolio, so pick something you are **interested in** or that's **useful** (either in some professional work or automating some task). [Learn how the project is evaluated (rubric)](https://github.com/pratt-savi-810/pratt-savi-810-2020-03-project).


#### Project Routes

There's a couple of routes you can go;

1. **Creating a Tool to Automate a Task** - usually for some task automation, less an analysis, more data engineering. 
2. **Performing Data Analysis to Answer a Research Question** - this type of project requires plots and data insights. 

Since writing the code is the challenging part. Do not think about this in scope of a normal project. **Keep your scope focused!** Keep it limited in functionality and if you finish early, you can add more features. I've seen students go down some pretty deep rabbit holes and emerge with some very disorganized projects. You could have only 30 lines of code or so, and still have a great project so long as the code is well written and the doc's are informative and it has some functionality that's useful in some capacity. Most likely someone such as a hiring manager will only glance at your Repository, so you want it to be organized and clean and very clear as to its purpose. 

## Assignment 04 Submission
You will **Fork** and **Clone this Repo** and **edit this README.md Markdown file**. This is your submission, just the link to your forked Repo and edited README.md file. This project should be the edited version of this README.md (**Markdown**) file. 

#### Learn more about [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). 

Most code editors allow editing of Markdown files, some recommended editors are;

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [StackEdit (edit in-browser)](https://stackedit.io/)
* [Dillinger (edit in-browser)](https://dillinger.io/)
* You can even edit inside of [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Executive Summary

A _brief description_ of your final project idea. 

- **Why** are you doing this project? 
- **How** do you imagine you'll accomplish this project? 
- Is this a project **Creating a Tool to Automate a Task** or **Performing Data Analysis to Answer a Research Questio**? 

This should be a paragraph or so and provide a _high-level overview_ of your project. Again this is a summary, so think of this as the "Elevator Pitch". 

## Background

A more **detailed background** of your project, please include any information that would be useful for understanding the context of the project. This can be as long or short as you'd like. 

## Resources
List any possible articles, resources or analysis or anything useful and include links and perhaps annotate a sentence as to the key findings of this resource. Or if you cannot find any resources please mention. 

#### Resources List

* Title A - link - description
* Title B - link - description 
* Title C - link - description 
 
## Input Data 

#### Data Sources List 
List any possible data including links with any input data sources you'll be using. 

* Data A - link - description
* Data B - link - description 
* Data C - link - description 

#### Data Wish List
List and describe any type of data you'd like to include but had difficulty tracking down. 

* Data Wish List Item A - description
* Data Wish List Item B - description

## Technical Requirements

#### Python Libraries
List any Python libraries you think you may need. Desribe what you may use them for. 

* Python Library A - description
* Python Library B - description
* Python Library C - description


#### Library Wish List
Also note any libraries or functionality that you may need that you're not sure exists. Try your best to articulate this in words. This will be helpful if I can provide any libraries to suggest for use in the project. 

* Python Library Wish List Item A - description of desired functionality
* Python Library Wish List Item B - description of desired functionality

## Measuring Success: 

- How will you measure your project's sucess?
	- Is there some metric you'd hope to generate from your project.  	 
	- Is there some plot or visualization that will be generated? 

	- Is some manual task now fully automated? 

## Project Execution Plan Outline
Please include a short outline describing the steps you'd imagine going through. 

Could be as simple as;

```
- Background Research 
	- Spend some time researching the topic

- Data Collection
	- Spend time collecting and looking for additional data
	 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
 	- Summarize the input data, plot and examine any columns that may be useful. 

- Data Processing
	- A couple of steps that may be needed to Process your data. 

- Results and Conclusion 
	- Key findings
	- Was your Project Successful. 
	- Generate Assumptions and Limitations. 
```
